name: Text in HTML
theory: |

  Within a browser or other program that can process HTML, the text is rendered based on the specified tags. Without them, the browser will not understand how to properly display the text.

  Let's look at an example of text and try to output it both with tags and without them.

  Text:

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3 bg-light font-monospace">
    <p>We believe that a true programmer must understand how a computer works and be able to think like a computer. They should see a problem, not an assignment. They must be able to analyze and reason at the level of the problem and above, not just at a code level.</p>

    <p>With today's abundance of study materials, courses, and books, the main question a beginner faces now is not "where to study?" but "what should I study and in what order?". There are many opinions on this subject. Some advise starting with mathematics, while others advise specific languages and technologies.</p>

    <p class="m-0">Hexlet is a ready-made path from absolute beginner to your first job.</p>
  </div>

  If you insert this text into the page without using tags, you'll get this result:

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">

  </div>

  This is not the result that was expected - the lines have been stuck together and turned into one unreadable wall of text. For the text to look as intended, it needs to be wrapped in `<p>` tags:

  ```html

  The example illustrates that text formatted in a word processor and then opened in a browser will be one continuous line, so the information needs to be marked with special tags. In this course, we'll look at tags for creating tables, lists, links, and page sections that make sense. In this lesson, we took a closer look at paragraphs and the importance of markup for proper output on a page.

  Format this text

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3 bg-light font-monospace">
    <p>My Circle, a career portal, studied the IT education market and determined which online schools teach programming well. In the final ranking, Hexlet came in second place.</p>

    <p class="m-0">"My Circle" surveyed 3,500 IT professionals and compiled a ranking table of online schools for programmers. "My Circle" and "Habr" users who attended online universities took part in the survey. In the final table, Hexlet came in second place.</p>
  </div>

  Each paragraph must be inside a separate tag
