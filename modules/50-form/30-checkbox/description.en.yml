  In online stores, purchases are often made by specifying the category that we want to search in. Checkboxes are used to implement multiple choices.

  Checkboxes allow you to select multiple items from the ones presented:

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example">
    <form>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox">
        I want to learn HTML
      </label>
      <br>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox">
        I want to learn CSS
      </label>
      <br>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox">
        I want to learn JS
      </label>
      <br>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox">
        I want to learn another language
      </label>
    </form>
  </div>

  Two tags are used to create a checkbox:

  * An `<input>` with `type="checkbox"`
  * A `<label>` tag which will contain the text associated with the checkbox we want

  There are two ways to link  `<label>` to `<input>`:

  * Link by `id`. To do this you must set a unique id for `<input>` and link the `<label>` tag with a checkbox using the for attribute.


  ```html
  <form>
    <input id="html" type="checkbox">
    <label for="html">I want to learn HTML</label>
  </form>
  ```

  * Put `<input>` inside the `<label>` tag. This does not require a unique `id`

  ```html
  <form>
    <label>
      <input type="checkbox">
      I want to learn HTML
    </label>
  </form>
  ```

  In order to be able to find out which items have been selected after sending the form to the server, the value attribute is used, containing the `value` that allows you to determine a selected checkbox.

  Since there can be many checkboxes on a page and they can belong to different forms, the `name` attribute is used to define a specific group of checkboxes. Each group of checkboxes has its own name, which you can use to separate groups of checkboxes when processing data on the server.

  ```html
  <form>
    <label>
      <input type="checkbox" name="languages" value="HTML">
      I want to learn HTML
    </label>
    <br>
    <label>
      <input type="checkbox" name="languages" value="CSS">
      I want to learn CSS
    </label>
    <br>
    <label>
      <input type="checkbox" name="languages" value="JS">
      I want to learn JS
    </label>
  </form>
  ```

instructions: |
  Create a form with a data handler file at `/people`. Create two text boxes inside the form. Link them by putting `<input>` inside `<label>`. Don't forget to add the `name` and `value` attributes
