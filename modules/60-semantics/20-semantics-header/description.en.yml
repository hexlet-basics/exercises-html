name: Header
theory: |
  The top area of the site is usually called the header and contains contact information, a menu, and a logo. Before the advent of the HTML5 standard, this area was simply marked up using the usual `<div>` block, which didn't quite make "sense" to browsers.

  HTML5 uses a paired `<header>` tag to mark up the header, with elements inside it.

  ```html
  <header>
    <img src="/logo.png" alt="Logo"> <!-- Site Logo -->
    <div id="menu"> <!-- Menu -->
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="/contacts">Contacts</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </header>
  ```

  The `<header>` tag doesn't differ from the tag `<div>` in terms of its behavior and does not have any significant standard styles, so it can be used on any site without fear of disturbing its appearance.

  Mark up a site header. Place a picture and a bulleted list with two links inside

tips:
  - The `header` element is not unique to the page. It can be used not only as a page header but also as a section header
