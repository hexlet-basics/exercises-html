name: Sidebar
theory: |
  Most sites have a sidebar. It serves to display information that supplements the main text but is not obligatory. It's most often a section menu, a list of definitions from the article, widgets, etc.

  In order to correctly mark up such an area, you can use the `<aside>` tag, within which the sidebar will be located. Let's add a sidebar with an additional menu to the example from the last lesson.

  ```html
  <header>
    <img src="/logo.png" alt="Logo"> <!-- Site Logo -->
    <nav> <!-- Menu -->
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="/contacts">Contacts</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <aside> <!-- Sidebar -->
    <nav> <!-- Additional page menu -->
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/service-1/">Услуга 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="/service-2/">Услуга 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="/service-3/">Услуга 3</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </aside>

  <main>
    <p>The main content of the page. This can be an article, a description of a service, data, contact information, or a form to order a service</p>

    <section class="callback-form">
      <h2>Place an order</h2>
      <form>
        <!-- Here is the service order form -->
      </form>
    </section>

    <section class="more">
      <h2>Read also</h2>
      <article class="article-block">
        <h3>Service 2</h3>
        <p>New service description</p>
        <a href="#">Service link</a>
      </article>

      <article class="article-block">
        <h3>Service 3</h3>
        <p>New service description</p>
        <a href="#">Service link</a>
      </article>

      <article class="article-block">
        <h3>Service 4</h3>
        <p>New service description</p>
        <a href="#">Service link</a>
      </article>
    </section>
  </main>
  ```

  Note that `<aside>` is contained outside of the `<main>` tag. This content does not have to be unique on every page. It can be unique for each specific section (if we're talking about a menu, for example). If the sidebar is unique to each page, it must be located inside the `<main>` tag.

instructions: |

  Create a website header. It should consist of 2 elements:

    * Logo
    * Navigation section. It should contain a bulleted list with two elements

  Add a `<main>` section. Inside, create a section with a header wrapped in an `<h2>` tag. Inside the section, create two blocks with descriptions of new services. Don't forget that inside the `<article>` tag, there should be a header. Mark up the headers themselves in `article` with the `h3` tag.

  Add a sidebar. It's unique to each page and contains text that applies only to that page. Insert any text inside the sidebar. Think about where exactly this area will be located

tips:
  - Although we were talking about the sidebar, `aside` designates a complementary area. However, it often visually looks like a sidebar
