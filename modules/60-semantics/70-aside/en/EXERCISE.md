Create a website header. It should consist of 2 elements:

  * Logo
  * Navigation section. It should contain a bulleted list with two elements

Add a `<main>` section. Inside, create a section with a header wrapped in an `<h2>` tag. Inside the section, create two blocks with descriptions of new services. Don't forget that inside the `<article>` tag, there should be a header. Mark up the headers themselves in `<article>` with the `<h3>` tag.

Add a sidebar. It's unique to each page and contains text that applies only to that page. Insert any text inside the sidebar. Think about where exactly this area will be located
