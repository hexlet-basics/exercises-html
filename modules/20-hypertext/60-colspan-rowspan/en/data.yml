    The number of cells in each row of the table must be the same after merging.
    It's important to distinguish between the number of `<td>` tags and the
    total number of cells. For example, using the `colspan="2"` attribute on a
    cell you will get two cells but visually combined in one. For this reason,
    it's necessary to remove one physical cell from the markup to compensate

    removed from the HTML code. If the `rowspan` attribute is used, the cells in
    the rows below are deleted
