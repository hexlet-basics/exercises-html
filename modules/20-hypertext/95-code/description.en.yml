name: Inserting computer code into HTML
theory: |

  If you have a programming tutorial blog or write articles, then you'll need to demonstrate your code. Every lesson on Code Basics has these blocks:

  ```html
  <p>You can see the markup here</p>
  ```

  To create a block of code, use the tag `<code>`, and you can write code in any language there.

  ```javascript
  // Example code in JavaScript
  const square = (num) => {
    return num * num;
  };
  ```

  The `<code>` tag is often used with the `<pre>` tag to preserve formatting. If the `<pre>` tag is not used, you have to control line breaks yourself, for example by wrapping each line with a `<p>` tag.

  It's important that all tags inside `<code>` are be processed by the browser, which is why special characters are used inside. Also, a common solution is to wrap the name of the tag in a separate tag, such as `<span>`:

  ```html
  <code>
    &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;Insert the p tag as plain text &lt;<span>/p</span>&gt;
  </code>
  ```

instructions: |
  Add any text to the `<code>` tag and paste it into the editor. Try different versions of the texts
