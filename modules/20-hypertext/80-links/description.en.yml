  In order to move between pages, one of the internet's main elements was invented, hyperlinks.

  Hyperlinks allow you not only to go to a given resource on the Internet, but also allow you to move within a document or page you're looking at. You got to this lesson through a hyperlink, too.

  To create a link, you use a paired `<a>` tag with the obligatory `href` attribute, which indicates the address of the page to which the link will go after it's clicked


  ```html
  <a href="link to a document">Link text</a>
  ```

  Links can be divided into 3 types:
  * **Relative**. If you click on this type of link on a given website, it'll lead to the same site
  * **Absolute**. These allow you to navigate to third-party resources on the Internet
  * **Anchors**. These are used to move within a page or document you're currently looking at

  The only difference between relative and absolute links is the format in which the link is specified. Relative links don't specify the address of the site that you will move to, it will be the same as the site you are currently on:

  ```html
  <!-- This link points to a document within the current site -->

  <a href="/languages/html">Return to a lesson selection</a>
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- This link points to a document within the current site.
       In this case to the main page of Code Basics  -->

  <a href="https://code-basics.com/">Go to Code Basics</a>
  ```

  **Anchor** links are easy to use within a large document and allow you to move the user to the right place. For example, if the page is a report, it's more convenient if you can quickly move back and forth between sections.

  Creating an anchor link consists of two actions:

  1. The part of the page you want to move to, you need to specify a unique identifier. This is done using the `id` attribute
  2. Add an `<a>` tag, and in the `href` attribute specify a link in the form of `#name-unique-identifier`

  ```html
  <a href="#anchor">Go to 2nd chapter</a>
  ...
  ...
  ...
  <div id="anchor">
      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  </div>
  ```
