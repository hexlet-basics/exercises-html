name: Special HTML Characters
theory: |
  There are special characters you can use in your text called mnemonic aliases. They allow you to use characters that are present in the symbol table but are not on the keyboard, such as math symbols or Greek:

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example">&xi; &pi; &upsih;</div>

  To record these characters, we use the `& character-name;` construction. It's important to pay attention to the letter case in the name of the character.

  Let's take the symbols of suits in cards as an example:

  |Character|Code|
  |--------|---------|
  |&clubs; |`&clubs;`|
  |&spades; |`&spades;`|
  |&hearts; |`&hearts;`|
  |&diams; |`&diams;`|

  Many of these symbols can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references).

  The main typographic mnemonic aliases in HTML are:

  * &nbsp; - a non-breaking space. This is a very important thing that allows you to stay on the same line of text so as not to spoil the logical structure of the text in certain cases
  * &laquo; and &raquo; - the left and right angle quotes («»). They're used everywhere in typography
  * &mdash; - a long dash

  Aliases are common when you want to insert tags without them being processed by the browser. In this case, you can use the aliases `&lt;` and `&gt;`, which are needed to denote **<** and **>**, respectively

  ```html
  &lt;p&gt; this markup will not be treated as a paragraph &lt;/p&gt;
  ```

instructions: |
  Write the "one-fourth" fraction symbol. You can find the alias of this symbol on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references)
