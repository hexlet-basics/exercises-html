name: Tables
theory: |

  One of the most familiar forms of presenting information is tables. We meet them everywhere: product information, multiplication table, documents. Such a filing makes it easy to compare the characteristics of certain products. In page layout, tables are used just as often, although they have a slightly confusing layout.

  A table is a composite element made up of several nested tags. This is similar to how lists are made up - there is a container and special tag elements inside it

  The marking contains several basic elements:

  * `<table>` — table area
    * `<tr>` — line
    * `<thead>` — table header
      * `<th>` — header cell
    * `<tbody>` — table body
      * `<td>` — cell

  Any table starts with a paired `<table>` tag

  ```html
  <table>
    <!-- Here will be the table data -->
  </table>
  ```

  It is within this tag creates rows and columns of the table. Now you can create rows and columns. The `<tr>` and `<td>` tags are used for this purpose. Create two rows and three cells in each row:

  ```html
  <table>
    <tr> <!-- Line -->
      <td>"Tota" Chocolate</td> <!-- Cell -->
      <td>100 gram</td>
      <td>20 dollars</td>
    </tr>

    <tr> <!-- Line -->
      <td>"Tota TeamLead" Chocolate</td> <!-- Cell -->
      <td>100 gram</td>
      <td>50 dollars</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <table class="table-bordered m-0 w-100">
      <tr> <!-- Line -->
        <td>"Tota" Chocolate</td> <!-- Cell -->
        <td>100 gram</td>
        <td>20 dollars</td>
      </tr>

      <tr> <!-- Line -->
        <td>"Tota TeamLead" Chocolate</td> <!-- Cell -->
        <td>100 gram</td>
        <td>50 dollars</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  **Important:** The number of cells in each row must be the same

  Try pasting this code into the editor. Notice that visually the output will be different from the table output in the theory of this lesson. The thing is that, by default, the browser doesn't put visible borders for the table cells. To do this, you need to use CSS, a special style language. You'll encounter this language and its capabilities in another course.

  The data is displayed, but there are not enough headings to describe each column. The `<thead>` tag is used to create the table header and the `<th>` tag is used as the cell tag. Otherwise, the structure of the layout does not change. Let's add the headings to the table:

  ```html
  <table>
    <thead> <!-- Table header -->
      <tr>
        <th>Yummy</th> <!-- Header cell -->
        <th>Weight</th>
        <th>Price</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tr>
      <td>"Tota" Chocolate</td>
      <td>100 gram</td>
      <td>20 dollars</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>"Tota TeamLead" Chocolate</td>
      <td>150 gram</td>
      <td>50 dollars</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <table class="table-bordered m-0">
      <thead> <!-- Table header -->
        <tr>
          <th>Yummy</th> <!-- Рeader cell -->
          <th>Weight</th>
          <th>Price</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tr>
        <td>"Tota" Chocolate</td>
        <td>100 gram</td>
        <td>20 dollars</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>"Tota TeamLead" Chocolate</td>
        <td>150 gram</td>
        <td>50 dollars</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  The last step is to add the `<tbody>` tag, which marks the main part of the table. Often developers miss it because browsers automatically wrap a group of lines that are not wrapped in other tags. Note that the `<tbody>` tag is often the only one in the table. In large tables, you can use several `<tbody>` to separate different sections in a table, but in most cases this is not necessary.

  ```html
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Yummy</th>
        <th>Weight</th>
        <th>Price</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody> <!-- Table body -->
      <tr>
        <td>"Tota" Chocolate</td>
        <td>100 gram</td>
        <td>20 dollars</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>"Tota TeamLead" Chocolate</td>
        <td>150 gram</td>
        <td>50 dollars</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  ```

  Additionally, you can specify the "footer" of the table. It can contain summary information, such as the cost of all goods.

  Tables can be configured with a header. It is needed when several tables are output at the same time. It helps to separate them from each other and not get confused about which table is delivering what. A paired `<caption>` tag is used to create the table title. If you have a header, it _must_ be placed immediately after the `<table>` tag. Let's add a header to the table:


  ```html
  <table>
    <caption>"Hexlet" chocolate assortment</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Yummy</th>
        <th>Weight</th>
        <th>Price</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>"Tota" chocolate</td>
        <td>100 gram</td>
        <td>20 dollars</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>"Tota TeamLead" chocolate</td>
        <td>150 gram</td>
        <td>50 dollars</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <table class="table-bordered m-0">
      <caption>"Hexlet" chocolate assortment</caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Yummy</th>
          <th>Weight</th>
          <th>Price</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>"Tota" chocolate</td>
          <td>100 gram</td>
          <td>20 dollars</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>"Tota TeamLead" chocolate</td>
          <td>150 gram</td>
          <td>50 dollars</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>


instructions: |
  Create a table of 3 rows with 2 cells in each. The first line contains the table headers

tips:
  - The number of cells in each row of the table must be the same
  - The `caption` of the table is _always_ placed immediately after opening the table
  - Browsers automatically add the `<tbody>` tag if it is missing. In small tables it can be omitted
