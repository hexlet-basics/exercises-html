name: Tables
theory: |

  One of the most familiar forms of presenting information is tables. We meet them everywhere: product information, multiplication table, documents. Such a filing makes it easy to compare the characteristics of certain products. In page layout, tables are used just as often, although they have a slightly confusing layout.

  A table is a composite element made up of several nested tags. This is similar to how lists are made up - there is a container and special tag elements inside it

  The marking contains several basic elements:

  * `<table>` — table area
    * `<tr>` — line
    * `<thead>` — table header
      * `<th>` — header cell
    * `<tbody>` — table body
      * `<td>` — cell

  Any table starts with a paired `<table>` tag

  ```html
  <table>
    <!-- Here will be the table data -->
  </table>
  ```

  It is within this tag creates rows and columns of the table. Now you can create rows and columns. The `<tr>` and `<td>` tags are used for this purpose. Create two rows and three cells in each row:

  ```html
  <table>
    <tr> <!-- Line -->
      <td>«Tota» Chocolate</td> <!-- Cell -->
      <td>100 gram</td>
      <td>20 dollars</td>
    </tr>

    <tr> <!-- Line -->
      <td>«Tota TeamLead» Chocolate</td> <!-- Ячейка -->
      <td>100 gram</td>
      <td>50 dollars</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <table class="table-bordered m-0 w-100">
      <tr> <!-- Line -->
        <td>«Tota» Chocolate</td> <!-- Cell -->
        <td>100 gram</td>
        <td>20 dollars</td>
      </tr>

      <tr> <!-- Line -->
        <td>«Tota TeamLead» Chocolate</td> <!-- Cell -->
        <td>100 gram</td>
        <td>50 dollars</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  ---

  **Important:** The number of cells in each row must be the same

  ---

  The data is displayed, but there are not enough headings to describe each column. The `<thead>` tag is used to create the table header and the `<th>` tag is used as the cell tag. Otherwise, the structure of the layout does not change. Let's add the headings to the table:

  ```html
  <table>
    <thead> <!-- Table header -->
      <tr>
        <th>Yummy</th> <!-- Header cell -->
        <th>Weight</th>
        <th>Price</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tr>
      <td>«Tota» Chocolate</td>
      <td>100 gram</td>
      <td>20 dollars</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>«Tota TeamLead» Chocolate</td>
      <td>150 gram</td>
      <td>50 dollars</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <table class="table-bordered m-0">
      <thead> <!-- Table header -->
        <tr>
          <th>Yummy</th> <!-- Рeader cell -->
          <th>Weight</th>
          <th>Price</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tr>
        <td>«Tota» Chocolate</td>
        <td>100 gram</td>
        <td>20 dollars</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>«Tota TeamLead» Chocolate</td>
        <td>150 gram</td>
        <td>50 dollars</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  The last step is to add the `<tbody>` tag, which marks the main part of the table. Often developers miss it because browsers automatically wrap a group of lines that are not wrapped in other tags. Note that the `<tbody>` tag is often the only one in the table. In large tables, you can use several `<tbody>` to separate different sections in a table, but in most cases this is not necessary.

  ```html
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Yummy</th>
        <th>Weight</th>
        <th>Price</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody> <!-- Table body -->
      <tr>
        <td>«Tota» Chocolate</td>
        <td>100 gram</td>
        <td>20 dollars</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>«Tota TeamLead» Chocolate</td>
        <td>150 gram</td>
        <td>50 dollars</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  ```

  Additionally, you can specify the "footer" of the table. It can contain summary information, such as the cost of all goods.

  Tables can be configured with a header. It is needed when several tables are output at the same time. It helps to separate them from each other and not get confused about which table is delivering what. A paired `<caption>` tag is used to create the table title. If you have a header, it _must_ be placed immediately after the `<table>` tag. Let's add a header to the table:


  ```html
  <table>
    <caption>«Hexlet» chocolate assortment</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Yummy</th>
        <th>Weight</th>
        <th>Price</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>«Tota» chocolate</td>
        <td>100 gram</td>
        <td>20 dollars</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>«Tota TeamLead» chocolate</td>
        <td>150 gram</td>
        <td>50 dollars</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <table class="table-bordered m-0">
      <caption>«Hexlet» chocolate assortment</caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Yummy</th>
          <th>Weight</th>
          <th>Price</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>«Tota» chocolate</td>
          <td>100 gram</td>
          <td>20 dollars</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>«Tota TeamLead» chocolate</td>
          <td>150 gram</td>
          <td>50 dollars</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>


instructions: |
  Create a table of 3 rows with 2 cells in each. The first line contains the table headers

tips:
  - The number of cells in each row of the table must be the same
  - The `caption` of the table is _always_ placed immediately after opening the table 
  - Browsers automatically add the `<tbody>` tag if it is missing. In small tables it can be omitted
