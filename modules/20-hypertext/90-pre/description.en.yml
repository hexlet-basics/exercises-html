name: Formatted text
theory: |

  Sometimes you need to insert text while retaining its original formatting. Let's take a look at Mayakovsky's famous "ladder" from the poem "To Sergei Yesenin.

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example">
      <pre>
      As the saying says,
                      you are
                            now far.
      Void and stars,
              a stodgy kind
                            passover.
      Not a payday,
                  not a whiskey bar.
      Sober.
      </pre>
  </div>

  Vladimir Mayakovsky believed that it was in this form that the rhythm of verse could best be framed.

  It is very difficult to format such text using special characters in HTML. You have to "juggle" with space characters. These markings will be very difficult to maintain in the future as a result:

  ```html
  <p>As the saying says,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now far.</p>
  ```

  To solve this problem, there is a special tag called `<pre>`, whose task is to display the text within itself while saving all the space characters. By default, the `<pre>` tag outputs text in a monospaced font in which all characters have the same width, unlike regular fonts.

  ```html
  <pre>
  As the saying says,
                you are
                      now far.
  Void and stars,
          a stodgy kind
                      passover.
  Not a payday,
              not a whiskey bar.
  Sober.
  </pre>
  ```

  Inside the `pre` tag, you can use tags to format the text: `<i>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<strong>`.

instructions: |
  Add any text to the `<pre>` tag and paste it into the editor. Try different versions of the texts.
