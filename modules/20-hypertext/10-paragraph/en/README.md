Paragraphs are the main way to divide a large text into small logical blocks. These blocks are automatically "indented" from each other. Such text is much easier to read and does not scare users.

Paragraphs are mostly found within large text. For example, any lesson on Hexlet or Code Basics is broken up into paragraphs for easy reading, just like this one.

It is broken down into small blocks of meaning. Not only is it more comfortable to read, but you can quickly find the information you need in a large text.

Paragraphs are created using the paired `<p>` tag with a small amount of text in the body. For example:

```html
<p>First paragraph</p>
<p>Second paragraph</p>
```

This is what they look like in the browser:

<div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
  <p>First paragraph</p>
  <p class="m-0">Second paragraph</p>
</div>
