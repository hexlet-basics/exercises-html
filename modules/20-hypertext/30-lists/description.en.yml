name: Lists
theory: |

  Lists are one way of presenting content on a page. With their help it is easy to group small related fragments, such as a shopping list:

  ```
  — Milk
  — Bread
  — Water
  ```

  You can make such a list with three paragraphs, but then, at first glance, it will seem that these are three different phrases not united by a common meaning.

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <p>Milk</p>
    <p>Bread</p>
    <p class="m-0">Water</p>
  </div>

  Lists are used to properly relate this information. To create them in HTML, several tags are used, nested within each other:

  * `<ul>` or `<ol>` to define the type of list
  * `<li>` to create a list item

  The general layout is as follows:

  ```
  <List_type>
    <list_item>Text</list_item>
  </list_item>
  ```

  ## Marked list

  The `<ul>` tag is used to create a bulleted list.

  Bulleted lists are used when the information does not require a specific sequence. For example, the grocery list from the example above. It is not so important what will be bought first: milk or bread, it is important to buy all the products.

  ```html
  <ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Bread</li>
    <li>Water</li>
  </ul>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <ul class="m-0">
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Bread</li>
      <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  ## Numbered list

  **Numbered** lists are used to group sequential information, an important feature of which is the presence of a serial number of the item.

  Such lists are useful if they indicate the sequence of actions to be taken. A numbered list is created with the `<ol>` tag, inside which also lie elements in the `<li>` tags.

  To-do list for the day

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <ol class="m-0">
      <li>Buy food</li>
      <li>Go to Alex</li>
      <li>Cook dinner</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  in HTML markup looks like this:

  ```html
  <ol>
    <li>Buy food</li>
    <li>Go to Alex</li>
    <li>Cook dinner</li>
  </ol>
  ```
